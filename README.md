"Survey on Implementing RAG in Software Engineering"
Published at the Korea Conference on Software Engineering 2024
Authors: Dimitri Romain BEKALE BE NDONG and Duksan Ryu

Overview
This repository contains the resources, supplementary materials, and code (if applicable) related to our paper that investigates the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the field of Software Engineering (SE).

The paper provides:

- A comprehensive survey of how RAG techniques are being applied within SE.

- An analysis of the common characteristics and patterns of system retrieval in SE.

- A discussion on the unique challenges and advantages encountered when implementing RAG for software engineering tasks.

Key Topics
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Understanding the architecture and workflow of RAG systems in software engineering applications.

- System Retrieval in SE:
Exploring typical retrieval mechanisms, data sources, and their impact on downstream tasks.

- Challenges:
Identifying obstacles such as data quality, domain adaptation, scalability, and integration with existing SE tools.

- Advantages:
Highlighting the benefits, including improved accuracy, enhanced context-awareness, and support for complex SE queries.
